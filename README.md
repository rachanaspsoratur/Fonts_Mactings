Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
Prepare your training data 
Set the image_path variable to the path of the test image for which you want to detect fonts.
Run the code                                                                                                                                                                 code editor:Jupyter notebook.
The detected fonts will be printed to the console.
used this technology Python for the programming language, along with OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical computations, and scikit-learn for the Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This combination of technologies is commonly used in computer vision and machine learning projects.
